# Week-14-Friend-Application
Friend Finder is an application to match for matching friends with similar likes and dislikes. Simply fill out the form and supply a picture of yourself.  After doing that,start answering the questions in the survey as honest as possible and watch the application do its magic!  Using your answers and the power of this application, it will match your selections with against some other friends and with the number difference, find the appropriate match.  After matching you up, it is entirely up to you at that point to reach out to your "Matched Friend."
